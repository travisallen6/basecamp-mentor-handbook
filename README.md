#Basecamp Mentor Guide

## Overview

Basecamp is DevMountain’s latest addition to our pre-course work. Basecamp is provided to students to help them set a pattern of accountability which will lead to success. Basecamp will replicate what the students will experience once they are attending DevMountain in person or online. We will cover HTML, CSS, JavaScript and even dip our toes in React and Node. We will also cover more basic things like picking a text editor and creating a usable file structure.

As mentors to Basecamp students, you will be some of their first point-of-contact to all things at DevMountain. It is expected that you will meet with each student for 30 minutes a week for six weeks. This contact would ideally happen outside of your regular work hours but we understand that the students also have lives going on right now as well so use your best judgment when scheduling times with the students.

**Please keep all meetings professional**

## Helpful Tools

There are a number of tools you can use to meet with your students. Here is a small list of what we recommend:

* [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/)/[appear.in](https://appear.in/) for face-to-face meetings.
* [codeshare.io](https://codeshare.io/)/[Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)/[repl.it](https://repl.it/) for testing their learning.
* [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) for organizing meetings with students.

These are just a few that are the most popular but feel free to use other tools to run your meetings.

## Student Introductions

Feel free to introduce yourself to your students as you would like but an great example intro email would look like this:

**Subject**: DevMountain Basecamp Mentor

"Hello,

My name is NAME and I will be your mentor for the next 6 weeks during your time in Basecamp. Basecamp is designed to get you ready to be successful during your time in-class at DevMountain.

Lets schedule a meeting to get to know each other and I can answer any questions you have about Basecamp and DevMountain. Here is a link to my calendar. **As a reminder, these weekly meetings are mandatory.**

I look forward to helping you become a great developer,

NAME"

##Goals

The main goals for Basecamp meetings are as follows: 

* Test students on their learning.
* Review any content that the student isn’t grasping.
* Tips for success during their time at DevMountain and as a developer.
* Campus specific questions
* What they do or not like about Basecamp

## Payment

You will be compensated for your meetings with students. Each meeting you will be paid $16.50. This equates to about $100 per student for the six weeks. These meetings should be on average 30 minutes. If meetings are continually running longer, please let me know.

It is expected that you attempt to reach out to a student three times per week if they are not responded. You will be paid the same as a meeting if it is noted that you have attempted contact three times.

## Keeping track of student progress
You will be given access to a spreadsheet to keep track of all students progress. These spreadsheets will have the students contact info as well as cohort info. A sample can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wKKhIiDZirS-E0WreFyH3uHlXNae1MaD1BT9nvCkGd4/edit?usp=sharing).

Please write complete and detailed notes. Things such as "Student is doing good" helps no one. Instructors and in-class mentors will rely on these notes to help assess understanding before the students start.

**Please also mark the dates you attempted to contact or contacted your student as this will be how we track how many meetings to pay you for**

You will also be added a mentor Slack channel if you need anything from your other mentors.

## Student progress

It is expected that students should progress through Basecamp. If you see that your student has stalled, please let me know ASAP so we can remedy the problem.

While completion of Basecamp has a very high priority, student comprehension is the most important. That is why weekly meetings with you the mentor are mandatory.

If you are having a difficult time contacting a student, please let me know so we can have myself or Admissions contact them to let them know their in-class spot may be in jeopardy.

## Curriculum Schedule

As talked about earlier, Basecamp is designed to give students a high level overview of what they will experience while attending DevMountain.

## Student FAQs
**What is Basecamp?**

Basecamp is a set of pre-course material for students before they attend DevMountain. Basecamp will help students set a pattern of accountability and will set the expectation of what their time at DevMountain will be like. We will be covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript and even basic React & Node. We will also cover the more basic things like picking a text editor and a file structure that will set students up for success.

**Will I have help during Basecamp?**

Absolutely! Learning to code can be difficult and we want to make this process as seamless as possible. Students will have access to weekly meetings with mentors to cover anything that might still be a little fuzzy. There will also be twice-weekly live QA/Review sessions where students will get to put what they have learned into practice. These QA/Review sessions will be recorded for later viewing as well.

**Does Basecamp cost anything**

Basecamp is provided at no additional cost to students. This is totally free with the cost of their tuition. We will be requiring that students do meet weekly with their Basecamp mentor to keep their in-class spot.

**Why am I having to do more pre-course work than someone who attended DevMountain before me?**

Basecamp is designed to create a solid foundation for students to become successful developers. The best way to learn to code is by doing. While there is more content than before, we also have given students more resources such as access to mentors and twice-weekly QA/Review sessions to help them during their time in Basecamp.

**How much time do I have to complete Basecamp?**

We will be giving students 6 weeks to complete Basecamp. We anticipate this will take anywhere between 40-50 hours to complete. This breaks downs to a little more than an hour per day, if the students choose to complete it that way. We will have mentors meeting with students weekly to make sure their learning is on track and set up for success once they attend DevMountain.
