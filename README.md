# Basecamp Mentor Guide

## Overview

 Basecamp is provided to students to help them set a pattern of accountability which will lead to success. Basecamp will replicate what the students will experience once they are attending DevMountain in person or online. We will cover HTML, CSS, JavaScript and even dip our toes in React and Node. We will also cover more basic things like picking a text editor and creating a usable file structure.

As mentors to Basecamp students, you will be some of their first point-of-contact to all things at DevMountain. It is expected that you will meet with each student for 30 minutes a week for six weeks. This contact would ideally happen outside of your regular work/class.

**Please keep all meetings professional**

## Helpful Tools

There are a number of tools you can use to meet with your students. Here is a small list of what we recommend:

### Face-to-Face Meetings
* [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/)
* [appear.in](https://appear.in/)

### Testing student learning
* [codeshare.io](https://codeshare.io/)
* [repl.it](https://repl.it/)

### Shifts
You can view a template of the Basecamp shift signup [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cqDOEMvpt6gT-9C3wCoOQ7Rs1CK0yT6_sXsBs1CQZjM/edit?usp=sharing). Shifts are twice a day Monday - Friday from 9A-12P.

If for any reason you are unable to make your shift, please let Bryan Smith (@bryan_smith on slack) know immediately.

### Scheduling Meetings
* A Basecamp Calendar can be viewed [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/3?cid=YmFzZWNhbXBAZGV2bW91bnRhLmlu). Students will sign up up for Basecamp meetings at this [Calendly link](https://calendly.com/basecamp-meeting/basecamp-one-on-one) and the meeting will then show on the shared Calendar

## Goals

The main goals for Basecamp meetings are as follows: 

* Test students on their learning.
* Review any content that the student isnâ€™t grasping.
* Tips for success during their time at DevMountain and as a developer.
* Campus specific questions
* What they do or not like about Basecamp

## Payment

You will be compensated for your meetings with students. Mentors will be paid at their regular hourly rate as long as the time they are working is Monday - Friay, 9-5


## Keeping track of student progress
Each time you meet with a student, please [fill out this form](https://goo.gl/forms/rhmE50afUBaMdEK72). Each part of the form is required and will be saved to a spredsheet. The form is broken down into
* Mentor Name
* Student Name
* Cohort
* Weeks until their cohort starts
* Did the student progress from the previous meeting (Mark yes for first meeting)
* Mentor Confidence in student on a 1-10 scale
* Notes for your meeting

The form can be filled out multiple times.

Please write complete and detailed notes. Things such as "Student is doing good" helps no one. Other Basecamp mentors, instructors and in-class mentors will rely on these notes to help assess understanding before the students start.

## Student progress

It is expected that students should progress through Basecamp. If you see that your student has stalled, please let me know ASAP so we can remedy the problem.

While completion of Basecamp has a very high priority, student comprehension is the most important. That is why weekly meetings with you the mentor are mandatory.

If you are having a difficult time contacting a student, please let me know so we can have myself or Admissions contact them to let them know their in-class spot may be in jeopardy.

## Student FAQs
**What is Basecamp?**

Basecamp is a set of pre-course material for students before they attend DevMountain. Basecamp will help students set a pattern of accountability and will set the expectation of what their time at DevMountain will be like. We will be covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript and even basic React & Node. We will also cover the more basic things like picking a text editor and a file structure that will set students up for success.

**Will I have help during Basecamp?**

Absolutely! Learning to code can be difficult and we want to make this process as seamless as possible. Students will have access to weekly meetings with mentors to cover anything that might still be a little fuzzy.
**Does Basecamp cost anything**

Basecamp is provided at no additional cost to students. This is totally free with the cost of their tuition. We will be requiring that students do meet weekly with their Basecamp mentor to keep their in-class spot.

**Why am I having to do more pre-course work than someone who attended DevMountain before me?**

Basecamp is designed to create a solid foundation for students to become successful developers. The best way to learn to code is by doing. While there is more content than before, we also have given students more resources such as access to mentors and twice-weekly QA/Review sessions to help them during their time in Basecamp.

**How much time do I have to complete Basecamp?**

We will be giving students 6 weeks to complete Basecamp. We anticipate this will take anywhere between 40-50 hours to complete. This breaks downs to a little more than an hour per day, if the students choose to complete it that way. We will have mentors meeting with students weekly to make sure their learning is on track and set up for success once they attend DevMountain.

## Mentor FAQ
**When will I be paid for Basecamp?**

Basecamp pay between Monday - Friday, 9-5 will paid with your normal pay. Any work done outside those times will be paid once a month at the end of the month.

**Can I text and call my students?**

Go for it. Ideally, communication will be kept through email but if they aren't responding then alternative methods are fine.

**My student isn't responding to me, what should I do?**

If you go more than a week without hearing from your student, please reach out to me ASAP so we can remedy the problem.
